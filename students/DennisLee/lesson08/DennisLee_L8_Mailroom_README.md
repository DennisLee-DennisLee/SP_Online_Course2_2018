# Instructions

Before running the 3 NoSQL database versions of the mailroom exercise, put the **config.ini** file in a **.config** folder directly under the directory in which this readme file is located.

To run each DB version of the mailroom, change the current directory in the console to **mailroom_mongodb**, **mailroom_neo4j**, or **mailroom_redis**, and then run **python mailroom_ui.py**.
