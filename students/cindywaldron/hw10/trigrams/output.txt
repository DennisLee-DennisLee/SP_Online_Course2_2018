Script done on Wed Dec 26 14:56:43 2018
 of        STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS  WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was looking full upon him, while the light that shone out of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the floors below; then coming straight towards his door.  "It's humbug still!" said Scrooge.  "I do," replied the Ghost. "Let us see another Christmas!"  Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the deadest piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of legs without a body: of which was hanging up in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.  Marley's Ghost held up its chain so hideously in the business. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came all the young men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to see the Spirit made towards the door; and he were partners for I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I say, God bless it!"  The man thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in only one respect. They often "came down" handsomely, and Scrooge sat busy in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the knowing ones call "nuts" to Scrooge.  "I am the Ghost and Scrooge, starting up into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with every person individually as he had fined five shillings on the threshold.  Now, it is impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? I am now to you, and I am standing in the air, each one connected with a struggle, "You think not."  "I have come to see me before that happened. Why give it as I think, children."  "One child," Scrooge returned.  "True," said the gentleman, "I wish to be worked all through, "Was it a dream or not?"  "What else can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot stay, I cannot rest, I cannot rest, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!"  It opened; and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost, wringing its hands again. "Mankind was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The common welfare was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my penance," pursued the Ghost, and with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.  Now, it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?"  "Nothing!" Scrooge replied. "He died seven years ago, this very night."  "We have no consciousness of us."  The more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.  Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come back here; but first, we're to be left alone," said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?  "The school is not quite deserted," said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bowed to him.  "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a dreadful state of mind or body to the two 'prentices, they did the same tap as he went.  You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the eyes were wide open, they were not."  "The school is not quite deserted," said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bowed to him.  "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been a blank at first, with power to render us happy or unhappy; to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the broad fields were so full of gratitude."  "Small!" echoed Scrooge.  "Because you fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the highest story of the door, except that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"  The Ghost stopped at the same hour. The bells ceased as they went past! Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see his poor forgotten self as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.  "There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a bell hanging in it. It was a pimple; and begged the Ghost repeated.  "Seven years dead," mused Scrooge. "And travelling all the Christmas long, and wound about him like a man out of his approach.  "Bah!" said Scrooge, "and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his curiosity. He looked out.  The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he had tasted before, he had a very small fire, but the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he heard the noise much louder, on the back of the story I am standing in the hall cried, "Bring down Master Scrooge's box, there!" and in a glow; his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his clerk, who in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.  "Slow!" the Ghost replied. "It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he had a very small fire, but fell upon his listening ear.  "Ding, dong!"  "A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" cried a cheerful voice. It was made when we were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the hair upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the Ghost of Christmas Past."  "Long Past?" inquired Scrooge: observant of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?"  The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it cried, "I know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up again; round and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the first to-morrow, when the bell tolled one.  "Humbug!" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.  After several turns, he sat down on the very wonder of this, I know how many years. Scrooge was not reading now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his cravat; put on his head, and on his lips, should be boiled with his own room; and so did every bell in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his pocket, and looking through his waistcoat, could see anything; and could see the Spirit at any period of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.  "Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig alive again!"  Old Fezziwig laid down his terror; for the jolly holidays.  He seemed to yield to the Ghost. "They have no doubt that Marley had no bowels, but he had been quite familiar with one arm, now with one old ghost, in a coach to bring you. And you're to be anonymous?"  "I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of it. What business had he to be smart, as a door-nail.  Mind! I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I say, God bless it!"  The cellar-door flew open with a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and lighted his candle.  He had just enough recollection of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend, the milkman. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the boy from over the way, and all the Christmas long, and have it over, Jacob?" hinted Scrooge.  "Why did you get married?" said Scrooge. "Was I apprenticed here!"  The man thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on at this rate, and began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the wall and the clerk, the undertaker, and the streets were lighted up.  The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep Christmas as a door-nail. I might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had not observed before; he was an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having wilfully "bonneted" the Spirit at any period of his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in chambers which had once belonged to his business better than you or I could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.  "Hilli-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the disjointed fragments of plaster fell out of a terrible sensation to which I have learned a Truth like this, I know of, in the closet; nobody in the life you have of my business!"  It was all in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could say they were within two paces of each other, until the broad fields were so full of gratitude."  "Small!" echoed Scrooge.  "I wish," Scrooge muttered, putting his hand upon the instant, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to be married to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his brow.  "That is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.  "Your welfare!" said the Ghost. "I made it horrible; but its horror seemed to yield to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he came home again after sailing round the island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all the time!"  "The hour itself," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair. If I was a tight-fisted hand at the clock, which pointed to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a door-nail. I might have lasted half a minute, but it had been a surprise to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to think of people below them as if he can, how it happened well that you have yet a chance and hope of being beyond the chance of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an empty store-house door, no, not a wrinkle in it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know how strong and irresistible it must have heard him thinking, for it said that he might keep his eye upon his feet again without a body: of which it now did with a thousand odours floating in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the windows of the evening with his former self, now grown a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was made plain enough, by the side of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its surface from the veneration due to its first position, and presented the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of "something" to the hour were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the other objects in the life you have of my procuring, Ebenezer."  "You are not looking at it," said the Ghost.  Scrooge trembled more and more.  "Or would you have of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you what I would. A very little then. All he could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been very slow about it, Jacob," Scrooge observed, in a faltering voice.  "It matters little," she said, softly. "To you, very little. Another idol has displaced you?" he rejoined.  "A small matter," said the Ghost.  "I am here to-night to warn you, that you awoke. May you be happy in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat down again. As he threw his head against the ceiling, and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and the hair upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, and examined the door towards the wall and the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which its light would have conducted me!"  It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped his robe in supplication.  "I am a mortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."  "Bear but a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.  "That is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his white comforter, and tried to say "Humbug!" but stopped at a distance.  "Who, and what are you?" Scrooge demanded.  "I don't know," said Scrooge. "Was I apprenticed here!"  They went, the Ghost of Christmas Past."  "Long Past?" inquired Scrooge: observant of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the wisdom of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!"  It put out its strong hand as it did so, "Let us go on."  They went, the Ghost insisted.  "No," said Scrooge, triumphantly, "and nothing else!"  He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.  Not a vestige of it was Christmas time again; but it had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the purest white; and round its head, as before. Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see me?" No beggars implored him to be left alone," said Scrooge.  "Plenty of prisons," said the Ghost.  Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his curiosity. He looked out.  The same face: the very day of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the Spirit at any given time, what would have become a mere United States' security if there were no dancers yet, as if it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.  "I have none to give," the Ghost of Christmas time, when it was wide open.  It was not reading now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his cravat; put on his coat behind.  Scrooge said that he had rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time of the things that have been," said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; "tell me, would you have yet a chance and hope of being beyond the narrow limits of our ancestors is in the yard were, but had a cold upon him so quickly that this was perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he was dreaming, but he had done so, said,  "Why! Is it not? He has the power for ever.  "Let me hear another sound from you," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair. If I was to be dismal? What reason have you to be sure!" said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot who goes about with him; he iced his office in the stables; and the night became as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the dressing of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the child, opening her eyes, "and are never to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.  Not so much that he appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.  "It's humbug still!" said Scrooge.  "I will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot who goes about with him; he iced his office in the outset that it was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so dreadfully cut up by candle-light, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it cried, "I know him; and at every chink and keyhole, and was brewing on a large scale.  The clerk in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom taking off the bandage round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its distinctness: being now a pair of legs without a pause, it came on through the open air.  "My time is nearly gone."  "I am!"  The jocund travellers came on; and as they got there; all top couples at last, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"  The air was filled with gladness when he heard the noise much louder, on the floor, in the life you have yet a chance and hope of my own knowledge, what there is nothing on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to think of people running to and fro, and making a great quantity of ground in seven years," said Scrooge.  The apparition walked backward from him; and when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, uncle!"  "Good afternoon!"  "Nay, uncle, but you never came to see his poor forgotten self as he could see, but it was only once a year.  "A small matter," said the Ghost. "Bless me, yes. There he is. He was endeavouring to raise his eyes sparkled, and his sister into the hall. But there was nothing on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.  "It's not convenient," said Scrooge, clasping his hands to stop them in their hands, and bowed to him.  Meanwhile the fog and even the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!"  Then, with a music-book, and went up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was with great astonishment, and with a booming sound, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as poverty; and there was nothing at all particular about the black old gateway of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a drip from the crown of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though it cried, "I know him; Marley's Ghost!" and fell asleep upon the next night when I pay a day's wages for no work."  The man thought he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.  "How it is that upon your cheek?"  Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully "bonneted" the Spirit in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in his bones.  To say that he had undergone, or the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley had no notion of walking.  But what did Scrooge care! It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his master; trying to hide himself behind the panelling, not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop them in their places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back before you in a lowering pile of building up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say "Humbug!" but stopped at the Ghost, "by Three Spirits."  Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the pursuit of wealth!"  "You are fettered," said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. "It isn't that, Spirit. He has spent but a drop of water in the house, that it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the Spirit. "Quick!"  This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and having every item in 'em through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might know it," observed the gentleman.  "It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's enough for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.  "Business!" cried the Ghost, "do you believe in me or not?"  "What is the even-handed dealing of the fireplace, as if they really were fellow-passengers to the old man's sense of feeling. He was about to speak; but with steadiness, upon him; "tell me, would you know," pursued the Ghost, "and had, as I am now to you, and I release you. With a full heart, for the rest of my hand there," said the child, brimful of glee. "Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much wiser, what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if with age; and yet the face had not the idle swinging of an embarrassing explanation. But the great effect of the purest white; and round its head, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the evening with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a real city were. It was made when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the hour of shutting up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the clerk's fire was so long, that he was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a lettuce growing out of sight, or perish.  There were more dances, and there was a tight-fisted hand at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him! And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his counting-house. It was the same problem to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? What reason have you to be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and back again to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of warmth. We choose this time, Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the floors below; then coming straight towards his door.  "It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's enough for a man of business on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was past two when he heard the noise much louder, on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the hall cried, "Bring down Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the Princess!"  To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a nuisance.  "Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the phantom, "not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the hour was passed; and, considering that he might keep his eye upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was a boy here!"  They went in. At sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was evening, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hands before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it had so little business to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business friends in the comprehensive ocean of my trade were but a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the little tailor, whom he had a large heart!"  "So she had," cried Scrooge. "You're right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!"  "She died a woman," said the nephew.  "What is the matter?" asked the Ghost.  "You will be haunted," resumed the Ghost, wringing its hands again. "Mankind was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my procuring, Ebenezer."  "You are quite a powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a white waistcoat, with a good man of business on the next night when the spectre reached it, it was the voice of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he would; and Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse was as dead as a Lord Mayor's household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had done so, said,  "Why! Is it not? He has spent but a drop of water in the air, a chilly bareness in the city, indeed.  "There's the Parrot!" cried Scrooge. "Green body and yellow tail, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.  A terrible voice in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of confused noises in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have forgotten it for so many years!" observed the Ghost.  "You wish to be together all the Christmas long, and wound about him on the spur of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lost the power for ever.  Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could no more go to Heaven, this was clearly the case; for though the eyes were wide open, they were now in one part and now in the air, each one connected with a touch of such weather as that, instead of being beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!"  It opened; and a wife and the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his bed were drawn.  The apparition walked backward from him; and when he had undergone, or the lateness of the growing tree would fall.  He seemed to yield to the multitude," returned the boy.  She shook her head.  "Am I?"  "Our contract is an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the emotion he had undergone, or the dull yard behind, not a clicking in the lamp heat of the gentlemen, referring to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self and Dick were turned from him, she resumed.  "You wish to be a man!" said the Ghost, "you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first syllable. And being, from the high desk, that if he can, how it happened well that you can see, I may not tell. But they and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the spirit raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.  "You see this toothpick?" said Scrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a coach to bring you home, dear brother!" said the Ghost, "and had, as I am not changed towards you."  "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"  "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied.  "You fear the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."  This was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there was no noise of people below them as if he were a bran-new man resolved to lie awake until the broad fields were so full of gratitude."  "Small!" echoed Scrooge.  "Expect the second on the next night at the grind-stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which I have thought of Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did so now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked fixedly at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.  "Hear me!" cried the Ghost, "do you believe in me," observed the Ghost. "No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse."  "You are quite a woman, little Fan!" exclaimed the Ghost, "do you believe in me or not?"  "What is the matter?" asked the question, because he didn't know where to have forgotten it for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very marrow in his usual character, he said, imploringly. "Old Jacob Marley, tell me higher, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, as they got there; all top couples at last, and not to think, the more he thought.  Marley's face. It was done in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the chimes of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the ground.  "Good Heaven!" said Scrooge, raising his voice. "You're particular, for a cap, which it now held under its arm.  "Rise! and walk with me!"  It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he said "Pooh, pooh!" and closed it with his cuff: "but it's too late now."  "What evidence would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!"  He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his own room; and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be able to say "to a shade," but substituted this, as more appropriate.  "In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us," said the Ghost. "They have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his friends, is left there still."  Scrooge seized the ruler with such severity as the Ghost's had done.  "Is that the weather and the baby sallied out to buy the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?" said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What right have you to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the weather and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a dreadful state of mind or body to the expectant clerk in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the fireplace, as if it was the first syllable. And being, from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about the black old gateway of the rolling year," the spectre raised a frightful cry, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.  "At this festive season of the night, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to regale him with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest thing about it was, that it was a boy," he said with a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to be married to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!"  The sound resounded through the world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of work cut out for them; three or four perhaps. Is that so much wiser, what then? I am standing in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to wink with his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the first syllable. And being, from the crown of its using, in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of distracting his own business, and not a sigh among the rest. But I am not changed towards you."  "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"  "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," said Scrooge.  "Both very busy, sir."  "It's humbug still!" said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."  His former self grew larger at the grind-stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which it is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no notion of walking.  But if you might come home; and he said impatiently.  "Your lip is trembling," said the Ghost. "But she had a cold in his garret, while his lean wife and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the air, each one connected with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the clerk's fire was so dense without, that although the court outside, go wheezing up and down its back, was white as if the Genius of the expression, and said that he might keep his eye upon his listening ear.  "Ding, dong!"  "Half-past!" said Scrooge.  "Because I fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if they really were fellow-passengers to the young men and boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come back here; but first, we're to be a man!" said the child, brimful of glee. "Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so hard as he went.  You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the room became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it now held under its arm.  Even this, though, when Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was made plain enough, by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his head, glanced anxiously towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was an excellent man of business, Jacob," faltered Scrooge, who now began to quake exceedingly.  "Hear me!" cried the Ghost, and became conscious that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his list. "Have I ever sought release?"  "In what, then?"  "In a changed nature; in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and over and over, and could see the two buttons on his head, and handed the credentials back.  "At this time of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his younger self, intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle as he went.  You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a pen, "it is more than you or I could work my will," said Scrooge. "Was I apprenticed here!"  They left the school behind them, they were now in one part and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.  Oh! But he said with a bang.  The Spirit must have sunk into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his heart, "and you shall be upheld in more than usually desirable that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all the time!"  "The school is not quite deserted," said the gentleman, but if it cost a fortune."  He was not its strangest quality. For as its great end. In everything that made my love of him you once were."  He felt the chilling influence of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir."  "It's not my business," Scrooge returned.  "True," said the nephew. "Christmas among the rest. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been justified in indicting it for so many years!" observed the Spirit.  "Nothing," said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."  "Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge.  "Expect the second on the spur of the night, that the Ward would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the bandage. He ventured to raise a fund to buy the beef.  Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good of which dissolving parts, no outline would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his lips, should be boiled with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the face and beyond its control, rather than a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."  This was not much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the dull yard behind, not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than usually desirable that we are two. How often and how keenly I have always thought of it, and the door towards the wall and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.  But what did Scrooge care! It was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking about him, after drying his eyes sparkled, and his coat-skirts, and the streets were lighted up.  The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the little tailor, whom he could make out was, that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.  "A golden one."  "This is the even-handed dealing of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, Jacob!"  "I don't know," said Scrooge.  "Ding, dong!"  "Half-past!" said Scrooge. "But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery, Jacob! Pray!"  "How it is so hard as he used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its surface from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good man of business on the door, saw in the lamp heat of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said Yes, you should; and even the little tailor, whom he had a large scale.  The mention of his wits. His heart and soul were in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his shoes to his chair, to save himself from falling in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to think of people running to and fro, and making a great piece of ironmongery in the wall, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a thousand odours floating in the windows of the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a poker.  Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and asked Scrooge if he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!"  "Yo ho, my boys!" said Fezziwig. "No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the merriest time in all his life to the top of the door, saw in the comprehensive ocean of my reality beyond that of your senses?"  "I wish I could say they were within two paces of each other, until the chime had gone home for the rest of the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a bell hanging in it. It was past two when he walked through his heart. He should!"  "Uncle!" pleaded the nephew.  "What is the matter?" asked the Ghost. "But she had a special desire to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!"  When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone home for the way, who was put down in his mind; and answered briefly, "Yes."  Although they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old Fezziwig would have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see me?" No beggars implored him to bestow the greetings of the face and beyond its control, rather than a merry Christmas. "Good afternoon!" said Scrooge. "Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done to him?  "The whole time," said the Ghost.  "You see this toothpick?" said Scrooge, caustic and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was brought about, Scrooge knew this, by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his knees.  "You wish to be his partner in every sense of the door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was hanging up in their lives. He had just enough recollection of the house, that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk came in with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as a means of warmth. We choose this time, Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him like a man to understand his own ramparts, than there would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an infernal atmosphere of life; another Hope as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and having read all the same to him.  Oh! But he put his hand upon the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was only once a year.  "A small matter," said the Ghost, "do you believe in me," observed the gentleman.  "It's humbug still!" said Scrooge. "I must. But why do you doubt your senses?"  "Because," said Scrooge, caustic and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more than this!"  As Scrooge looked at the outer door to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it cannot share, but might have been a party. But I am going to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all."  The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of the building. It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge held on tight to his tears.  The curtains of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his legs, and a bell hanging in it. It was a great quantity of ground in seven years," said Scrooge.  The same face: the very deuce with him. He then conveyed him and his nightcap; and sat down before the good Saint Dunstan had but that he was dead? Of course he did. He went the whole of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order," and so did every bell in the back-shop.  During the whole day. Be here all alone, he did look cautiously behind it first, as if they had been two inches taller he must have got into the works. Twelve!  He was not addressed to Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"  "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied. "He died seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the stairs; then coming up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.  You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of being so close beside him, it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps as he could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man can say Jack Robinson!"  You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the veriest old well of a neighbouring church struck the hours and quarters in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked about him. "I was a great relief, because "three days after sight of this time, Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him like a tail; and it was Christmas time again; but it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a booming sound, and then ran home to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have been a surprise to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep its distance, was what the Ghost returned, "that the spirit at your elbow.  It certainly was; for they had begun, together. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a suspicious attitude against the ceiling, and the streets were lighted up.  The clerk in the street to say, with gladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me no more; and look that, for your own way, and let me keep it in mine."  "Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew. "But you don't go into Parliament."  "Don't be cross, uncle!" said the child, opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here; but first, we're to be seen. The darkness and the streets were lighted up.  The man thought he was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of man who knew his business better than an evil eye, dark master!"  But if they really were fellow-passengers to the last. So A Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What right have you to be covered.  "What!" exclaimed the Ghost, and became conscious that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the room became a little market-town appeared in the house, not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his feet again without a head, now a thing with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a thing like a child as like an old one. It was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the bleak, dark night.  In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend, the milkman. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend, the milkman. In came the housemaid, with her head turned from them, that he could see anything; and could make nothing of it. What business had he to be merry? What reason have you to be covered.  "What!" exclaimed the Ghost, or the dull conversation of the hand, he became sensible of the day, or his order," and so surely as the deadest piece of work cut out for them; three or four perhaps. Is that so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the arm, and pointed to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance-- literally to astonish his son's weak mind.  Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the weather and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with every person individually as he looked, he saw a locomotive hearse going on at this phenomenon, it was made, you were false enough to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again the other objects in the streets, stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his belt, and leading by the bandage. He ventured to raise a fund to buy the beef.  Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good days in the long ends of his head, and handed the credentials back.  "At this time of the stomach makes them cheats. You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a pen, "it is more than this!"  As the words were spoken, they passed through the open air.  "My time grows short," observed the Ghost.  "Nothing particular," said Scrooge.  "Because I fell in love."  "Because I fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if that were the cause of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?"  "Nothing!" Scrooge replied.  "You see this toothpick?" said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used, when I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?"  The Spirit gazed upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a reason for not coming now?"  "Good Heaven!" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the chin. "But I suppose you must have been in vain for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his counting-house. It was double-locked, as he had a cold in his dressing-gown, which was not conscious of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a booming sound, and then would wag their tails as though it were at a certain warehouse door, and walked across the room.  After several turns, he sat down on the arm, and pointed to the window. He was not startled, or that his blood was not much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.  "Business!" cried the Ghost. "They have no just cause to grieve."  "What evidence would you know," pursued the Ghost, "the weight and length of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. "To bring you home, dear brother!" said the gentleman, "I wish to be covered.  "What!" exclaimed the Ghost, "you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first intimation he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as any man in the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of those dainties to the multitude," returned the nephew gaily. "What right have you to be his partner in every sense of feeling. He was very much attached to its first position, and presented the same hour. The third upon the fire; and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!"  "But you might know it," observed the Ghost. "And what is that upon your cheek?"  Scrooge muttered, with an undoubted bargain.  The apparition walked backward from him; and when he heard the noise much louder, on the clerk, with the long calendar of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an empty store-house door, no, not a drip from the opaque walls of his hands, "before a man to be terrified with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in the business. In came all the same problem to be left alone," said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What right have you to be a man!" said the Ghost. "A solitary child, neglected by his fellow-'prentice.  "Dick Wilkins, to be dismal? What reason have you been, Robin Crusoe?'  The air was filled with gladness when he walked home.  Scrooge having no better answer ready on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his nightcap; and sat down upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a lowering pile of building up a good man of business on the clerk, with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it can be apart from that--as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the air, a chilly bareness in the air, each one connected with a growl. The office was closed in a faltering voice.  "It matters little," she said, softly. "To you, very little. Another idol has displaced you?" he rejoined.  "A quarter to it," said the Ghost. "A solitary child, neglected by his surviving partner," said the Spirit, laying it upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his dressing-gown, which was beautiful. It held up its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the top of his bed were drawn.  The more he thought, the more he thought.  Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was Christmas time again; but it was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.  "How it is so hard as he had done so, said,  "Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he came home again after sailing round the island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he walked through his rooms to see me no more; and look that, for your own way, and let me keep it in mine."  "Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew. "You don't believe in me," observed the gentleman.  "It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's enough for a moment you were another man."  "I was bred in this place. I was afraid, from what you are," she returned. "I am. That which promised happiness when we were both poor and content to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to regale him with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his usual melancholy tavern; and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the heart of Scrooge with fervour; "I could walk it blindfold."  "Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!" observed the Ghost.  "You may--the memory of what is called fancy about him as any man explain to me, Jacob!"  "I am!"  The cellar-door flew open with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.  "There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and lighted his candle.  He did pause, with a touch of my business!"  It would have been more conducive to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a door at the candle; in which effort, not being a man can say Jack Robinson!"  You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a pen, "it is more than usually desirable that we are two. How often and how keenly I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there."  "Many can't go there; and many would rather die," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used, when I was your partner, Jacob Marley."  "Can you--can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.  Meanwhile the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house.  This was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the heart of Scrooge with fervour; "I could walk it blindfold."  "Strange to have forgotten it for a moment, joined in the light upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.  The sound resounded through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir."  "It's humbug still!" said Scrooge.  His former self and Dick were turned from him, she resumed.  "You recollect the way?" inquired the Spirit.  "Nothing," said Scrooge. "Was I apprenticed here!"  They went in. At sight of this supposition, in spite of the season on the opposite side of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the two 'prentices, they did the same tap as he looked the phantom taking off the bandage round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which it had begun to wear it low upon my brow!"  Scrooge asked the Spirit. "Quick!"  This was not an hour richer; a time for paying bills without money; a time for paying bills without money; a time for balancing your books and papers in their places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back before you in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the spirit at your elbow.  It held up its hand, warning him to listen to the wish; and Scrooge walked out with a sharp clap of his dressing-gown before he shut his heavy door, he walked home.  Scrooge went to bed again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in only one respect. They often "came down" handsomely, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, and passed into the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it. And he sobbed.  They walked along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep Christmas as a reason for not coming now?"  "Good afternoon!"  "Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a Lord Mayor's household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the next night when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his former self grew larger at the grind-stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet the face had not observed before; he was more than usually desirable that we are two. How often and how keenly I have been a party. But I have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner," said the nephew.  "What Idol has displaced me; and if it was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life inquired the way to the last. So A Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be together all the world."  "You recollect the way?" inquired the Spirit. "Quick!"  This was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the bleak, dark night.  In came the boy from over the casks in the spectre's voice disturbed the very wonder of this, it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it did so, "Let us go on."  They went, the Ghost returned, "that the spirit raised a cry, and shook its chain so hideously in the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the candle; in which effort, not being a man out of a city, where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the first syllable. And being, from the half-thawed water-spout in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his dressing-gown before he shut the door; and he were quite used to be.  Not a latent echo in the prime of life. His face had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his hands, "before a man to understand his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the hour of shutting up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a party. But I have thought of Christmas Past."  "Long Past?" inquired Scrooge: observant of its head and chin, which wrapper he had rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time of the story I am now to you, and I say, God bless it!"  The apparition walked backward from him; and at every chink and keyhole, and was brewing on a sudden, that the chance of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the fire; and Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see me?" No beggars implored him to be left alone," said Scrooge.  "Something, I think?" the Ghost had entered. It was long, and have the whole day. Be here all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a merry Christmas. "Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.  His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to stop the dance, cried out, "Well done!" and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the house, that it is impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? I am not changed towards you."  "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"  "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," said Scrooge. "Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't mean that, I am not changed towards you."  "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"  "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied. "He died seven years ago, this very night."  "We have no consciousness of us."  The quarter was so dense without, that although the court was of the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it. What business had he to be dismal? What reason have you to be trifled with; people who were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he tried to do, I have thought of it, and can release you."  "Have I ever sought release?"  "In life I was to be covered.  "What!" exclaimed the boy.  "Yes!" said the gentleman, "I wish to be his partner in every sense of the expression, and said that he appeared to know him; Marley's Ghost!" and fell asleep upon the next night when the chimes of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that were the cause of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?"  "Nothing!" Scrooge replied.  "You travel fast?" said Scrooge.  "I have none to give," the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he went.  You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an empty store-house door, no, not a squeak and scuffle from the view, and being diminished to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his life. He then conveyed him and his heart leap up as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the Invisible World, or the lateness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the life you have yet a chance and hope of being so close beside him, it were too warm to wear it low upon my brow!"  Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his coat behind.  Scrooge knew no more than you or I could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.  "Hilli-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his business better than you or I could have asked him; but he had fined five shillings on the back of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the lamps as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.  "There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: "my clerk, with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their lives. He had just enough recollection of the wind," replied the Ghost, "by Three Spirits."  Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.  "Dick Wilkins, to be covered.  "What!" exclaimed the boy.  She shook her head.  "Am I?"  "Our contract is an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having wilfully "bonneted" the Spirit made towards the window, and examined the door by which I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the broad fields were so full of gratitude."  "Small!" echoed Scrooge.  The clerk promised that he was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it seemed as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the Ghost, and became conscious that it was so long, that he could hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door.  "It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair. If I was not startled, or that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it was quite dark already-- it had not been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the multitude," returned the nephew. "Christmas among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the harsh and rigid lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of those dainties to the window: desperate in his cap; and begged the Ghost of Christmas Past.  "It is required of every man," the Ghost again stood side by side in the hall appeared the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the impropriety, he poked the fire, but the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then he heard the noise much louder, on the arm, and pointed to his list. "Have I ever sought release?"  "In a changed nature; in an erect attitude, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the fire; and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.  The Spirit touched him on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the very same. Marley in his belt, and leading by the dressing of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lost the power to shape some picture on its surface from the veneration due to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an undoubted bargain.  The curtains of his wits. His heart and soul were in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face. It was a large house, but one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down before the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his master; trying to hide himself behind the panelling, not a drip from the high desk, that if he half expected to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it had so little business to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when the phantom taking off the bandage round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which it is so hard as poverty; and there was a great extinguisher for a nuisance.  "Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the Ghost.  Scrooge lay in this state until the broad fields were so full of gratitude."  "Small!" echoed Scrooge.  Once upon a time--of all the other way; down the pen again.  "And A Happy New Year!"  "Good afternoon," said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."  "Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge.  "But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew. "Why?"  "Why did you get married?" said Scrooge. "I must. But why do they come to bring you. And you're to be anonymous?"  "I have come to bring you. And you're to be a man!" said the child, opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here; but first, we're to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had lost the power for ever.  Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could see, but it had been twice as many--ah, four times--old Fezziwig would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken it broadwise, with the sleeve of his life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.  "Your reclamation, then. Take heed!"  It was all in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:  "Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!"  Scrooge's former self turned down the middle and up again; round and round its head, as before. Scrooge knew and named them every one.  "Humbug!" said Scrooge; and walked across the hall, and up courts; and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as poverty; and there was nothing on which it now did with a touch of such weather as that, instead of being so close beside him, it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and Scrooge sat down before the hour was passed; and, considering that he tried to warm them. The city had entirely vanished. Not a latent echo in the spectre's being provided with an improved opinion of himself, and in a swoon. But how much greater was his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not conscious of a visitation when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his ferret eyes, when the spectre raised a cry, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.  "At this time of the door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not until now, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his own business, and not too much getting up by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge out of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom taking off the dark leaves of the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great spirits, and shouted to each other, Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it seemed as if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley was as snug, and warm, and the tenderest bloom was on his hat.  "You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?" said Scrooge.  The quarter was so long, that he had locked it with increasing steadiness, was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his white comforter, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and thought, and thought it over and over, and could see anything; and could make out was, that from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have conducted me!"  It was not until now, when the jaws were brought together by the side of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the wish; and Scrooge never did.  Nobody ever stopped him in the life you have chosen!"
