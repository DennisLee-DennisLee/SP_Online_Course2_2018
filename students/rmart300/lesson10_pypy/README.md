Lesson 10 Performance with PyPy
===============================

Tested two scripts with python 3.6 and pypy 3.5 v6.0

1. binary search

2. search fastq for motif


PyPy improves performance of binary search

PyPy did not perform as well on text search using regular expressions in search fastq for motif script
