This is my 2nd Python class for me. I have previously worked in Python but just winged it so now I decided to have a more formal education and I consider UW the best option for me.
I am glad to have the oportunity to have the chance to study here. The only regret is that I can't do it in the regular class setup to connect
more with other students.
