Python 220 - Advanced Programming in Python
============================================

I'm excited to continue learning more about Python.

I am currently a developer for my organization. Part of my daily work activities include the creation of various scripts to help automate various tasks. Script automation combined with some data analysis allows us to quickly determine possible any possible threats as well as areas of improvement.

I am looking forward to learning more about Python so I can continue sharpening my development skills.
